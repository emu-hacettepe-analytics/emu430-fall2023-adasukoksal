# Differences between R and Phyton

Although both R and Python are programming languages, they have differences and similarities. In this article, I will tell you about the differences between these two languages. I will exemplify the differences with code writing. One of the common points of the two programming languages ​​is that the print command is used in the same way in both. The print command can be used to write text in both R and Python. But when it comes to processing, R remains much simpler and more understandable than Python. Because we can write the operations directly, but in order to perform operations in Python, we first need to assign the numbers.

## (a) R Programing

This is how we perform using the r programming language.

```{r}

1 + 1

print("Hello World")
min(1, 0.75, 1.25) 

```

## (b) Python
```{python}
x = 5
y = 3
print(x + y)
```
