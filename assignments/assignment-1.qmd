# Differences between R and Phyton

```         
Although both R and Python are programming languages, they have differences and similarities. In this article, I will tell you about the differences between these two languages. I will exemplify the differences with code writing.
This is how we perform using the r programming language.
```

```{r}

1 + 1
```

In the Python programming language, performed as follows.

```{python}
x = input("Type a number: ")
y = input("Type another number: ")

sum = int(x) + int(y)

print("The sum is: ", sum)
```

My first assignment has two parts.
